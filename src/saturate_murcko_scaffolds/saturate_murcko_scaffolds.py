"""Read Smiles of Murcko scaffolds and return these as 'saturated'.

The Bemis-Murcko scaffold [1] provided by DataWarrior [2] retains
information about bond order and chirality, which simplifies the
structure of Benomyl[3] (i.e., of methyl 1-(butylcarbamoyl)-2-
benzimidazolecarbamate, CAS-RN 17804-35-2) to benzimidazole.  Note,
DataWarrior equally offers to identify the Bemis-Murcko skeleton; in
case of Benomyl the simplification yields octahydro-1H-indene.

There are instances where an intermediate simplification is required,
retaining only information atom connectivity which corresponds to the
assumption 'there are only single bonds' and a neutral state.
Benomyl, already simplified by DataWarrior to benzimidazole, thus
yields octahydro-1H-benzimidazole

The script works from the CLI of Python with listing file containing
the SMILES to work with as mandatory parameter:

python saturate_murcko_scaffolds.py [example.txt]

Results are written into file example_sat.txt.  Only SMILES with one
or zero pairs of square brackets (e.g., [Sn], [S@], [Fe3+]) are touched.

    + application of the mere string.uppercase() approach could transform `[sn]`

      of square brackets (you don't want to have `S` sulfur and `N` instead).
