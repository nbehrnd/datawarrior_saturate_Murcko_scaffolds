"""tests for saturate_murcko_scaffolds.py

This script checks results by script `saturate_murcko_scaffolds.py` with
pytest.  The coverage is incomplete, already because checks currently don't
import individual functions, i.e. only black box-tests are run.

Test setup, for instance in Linux Debian 13/trixie:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nbehrnd/datawarrior_saturate_Murcko_scaffolds.git
cd ./datawarrior_saturate_Murcko_scaffolds
python -m venv sup
source ./sup/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest
```

This approach was tested and run successfully in Linux Debian 13/trixie
with Python 3.12.6, and Pytest 8.3.3 as fetched from PyPi.org.

The SMILES used in the tests were checked with the visual output as .png
provided by OpenBabel.[1]

There are additional SMILES in sub folder `test_data` used e.g., to
generate an illustration on the project's landing page.  These were
exported by DataWarrior.[2]

[1]  OpenBabel (http://www.openbabel.org) as version 3.1.1 for Linux
     Debian 12 / bookworm, branch testing (Jan 4, 2023), was used.
